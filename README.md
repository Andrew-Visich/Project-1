What makes the best rated chocolate? 

Our team is looking for relationships between country of origin for beans, country of production, cocoa percentages, cocoa bean types, and ratings. We are using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings


Investigate if there is a correlation between the year the chocolate was judged and its average rating, plot the count to understand if the rating was affected by the number of competing companies (bar chart with count and average by year)
Generate a map that shows producing companies and where they source the beans.

Investigate if higher ratings are correlated with a particular type of cocoa bean.
